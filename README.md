## Rules & Info
 ---
 1. &nbsp; Enter your Bet Amount to Start.
 2. &nbsp; Having a Blackjack (Ace + King, Queen, or Jack) wins you 1.5x the Amount you Bet.
 3. &nbsp; Aces are worth 1 or 11. King, Queen, and Jacks are worth 10.
 4. &nbsp; You bust if hand is higher than 21.  The max handsize is 5.
 5. &nbsp; If hand is at 21, you are prevented from hitting yourself further.
 6. &nbsp; Dealer stays at 17 but auto draws/hits when lower than 17.
 7. &nbsp; Dealer wins in the case of ties.
 8. &nbsp; You can continue playing when balance is at $0.  Simply put in a bet of 0.

## Notes:
 ---
 - I do plan to add Card Backgrounds and perhaps Chips in place of the current Balance
 - Why so many semicolons and capitalized Methods/Functions? Habit from C# and Unity...
