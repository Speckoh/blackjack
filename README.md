# BlackJack 21 - Demo Version
 
This is a very simple BlackJack Demo Version I have done on the side to familiarize myself with Vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS.  This was done during winter break prior to my General Assembly Project 1.
Why so many semicolons and capitalized Methods/Functions? Semicolons were from my prior knowledge of C# and I was Capitalizing all my methods when I was self teaching myself in Unity Game Engine.
